### Predicting Electric Vehicle Charging Loads
In this project, you will use PyTorch to train a neural network to predict residential electric vehicle charging loads using real-world data from apartment buildings in Norway.

In particular, you will use input features like

* plug-in duration
* whether the location is private/public
* the month
* the day of the week
* traffic density
to predict
* the actual charging load in kilowatt hours for a charging session

If it performs well, a model like this could be useful in predicting things like energy costs when developing EV charging infrastructure.
